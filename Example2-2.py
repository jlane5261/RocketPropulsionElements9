The following measurements were made in a sea level test of a solid
propellant rocket motor:

Burn duration                           40 (seconds)
Initial mass before test                1210 (kg)
Mass of rocket motor after test         215 (kg)
Average thrust                          62,250 (N)
Chamber pressure                        7.00 (MPa)
Nozzle exit pressure                    0.07 (MPa)
Nozzle throat diameter                  0.0855 (m)
Nozzle exit diameter                    0.2703 (m)


Determine m_dot, v_2, c*, and c at sea level. Also, determine the pressure thrust and Isp at sea level, 1000 m, and 25000 m altitude.
Assume an invariant thrust and mass flow rate and negligible short start and stop
transients.
